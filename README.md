## Exercise 1

This exercise was designed by our teacher - [Francisco Pina-Martins](https://github.com/StuntsPT) to introduce us to Python, HTML and Markdown.

The assessment can be found on the website https://stuntspt.gitlab.io/pab_22-23/classes/practicals/ex01.html

The resulting project contains 4 HTML, 2 Python and 1 Markdown files.

All the files run simple ```Hello World``` programs and served as a quick guide on how to embed multiple properties
into our HTML code, including a Javascript script that was previously written and on how to write and run an interpreted
Python program.

The 3rd HTML exercise presented by our teacher was a play around challenge where we could
edit some HTML properties to present a different output on a web browser.

After playing around with some colours I decided to clone a 
todo HTML page made by [pyscript](https://github.com/pyscript)
This clone has an embedded python program that I've tweaked in order to gain some willpower to motivate me throughout
this bachelor.

Feel free to try it out and let me know if you can find and correct my Easter Egg. (It is easy.)

In the end of the class we were introduced to the Zen of Python by creating a file containing 
the ```import this``` library, as an Easter Egg.

Running this file prints the Zen of Python by [Tim Peters](https://github.com/tim-one), where he tries to show us the 19 guiding principles
for Python design.
